      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of this project was to redesign an existing website to make it
        more usable, accessible and responsive across various screen sizes
        (computer, tablet and mobile). I engaged in the design process, from
        sketching to hi-fi mockups, and then used HTML and CSS to code the
        interface!

      <h2>Part 1: Identifying Usability Problems</h2>
      <h3>Picking a Webpage</h3>
      <p>
        This website provides people with information about Columbia Road in
        London, which is often bustling on Sundays with a flower market and many
        local shops. I chose the Columbia Road website because I feel that the
        existing interface lacks visual hierarchy and is not intuitive to use,
        which is unfortunate given the vibrant energy in this part of London.
        Here is the
        <a href="https://columbiaroad.info/">link</a> to the website, and below
        are images of the homepage (focus of my redesign):
      </p>
      <div class="image-container hor-section">
        <img alt="Website home page image 1" src="./assets/CR-home1.png" />
        <img alt="Website home page image 2" src="./assets/CR-home2.png" />
        <img alt="Website home page image 3" src="./assets/CR-home3.png" />
      </div>
      <div class="image-container hor-section">
        <img alt="Website home page image 4" src="./assets/CR-home4.png" />
        <img alt="Website home page image 5" src="./assets/CR-home5.png" />
        <img alt="Website home page image 6" src="./assets/CR-home6.png" />
      </div>
      <div class="hor-section">

          <h3>Usability Problems</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The navigation menu only appears at the beginning of the webpage,
              yet the logo and timing remain at the top of the screen when
              scrolling. This makes it tedious to navigate to another page since
              you must scroll to the beginnning of the website, and it
              contradicts typical website conventions in which the navigation
              menu constantly remains on the screen.
            </li>
            <li>
              It is unclear what text and images are clickable since they looks
              visually the same as the rest of the paragraphs and images.
            </li>
            <li>
              There is little visual distinction between different sections,
              particularly immediately following the initial image. Also, since
              the font weights and sizing are inconsistent in this part of the
              website, it is difficult to find information quickly.
            </li>
            <li>
              When resizing the interface, one of the shops disappears, yet
              there is a space in its place. This can be confusing to users as
              to why there is a discrepancy between different screen sizes.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="accessibility" class="half-width">
          <h3>Accessibility</h3>
          <div class="hor-section">
            <img
              id="wave-img"
              alt="Website home page image 4"
              src="./assets/Original-Website-WAVE.png"
            />
            <p>
              The problems detected by WebAIM Wave, an accessibility checker,
              include a linked image missing alt text, empty links and redundant
              links. I agree with the issues detected. Some of the links appear
              to be hidden behind graphic elements, which may be confusing to
              screenreaders (users of the website without screenreaders would
              not notice the links). In addition, when resizing the interface to
              tablet or mobile, one of the shop images dissapears yet the link
              remains. Overall, there appeared to be no accessibility issues
              with the color contrast, which makes sense given that the
              black/dark gray text is presented on a light background.

          <h3>Speed Sketching</h3>
          <p>
            I drew nine sketches in nine minutes to brainstorm potential
            designs!

        <h3>Visual Design Style Guide</h3>

          My style guide allowed me to visualize the colors, fonts, icons and

        <h3>High-Fidelity Mockup</h3>
        <p>
          Using the style guide, I could bring the low-fidelity wireframe to
          life as a high-fidelity mock up. During this process, I made revisions
          to my sketches, low-fidelity wireframes and style guide when I wanted
          to add or remove an element now that I could see the design with
          styling.

      <h2>Part 3: Responsive Redesign</h2>
      <p>
        You can visit my redesigned website
        <a href="https://rdbrooks.github.io/columbia-road-web-redesign/">here</a
        >!
      </p>
      <p>
        WebAIM Wave detected zero errors with the website and had one alert
        about a skipped heading size. This decision was intentional because I
        wanted the "Welcome to Columbia Road" to be the focus when opening the
        page, and the website felt too crowded in tablet/mobile version when the
        opening times was the next heading size. This project taught me a lot
        about the design process, and I hope to continue using these practices
        when creating websites in the future.
